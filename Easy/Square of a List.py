'''
Given a list of integers sorted in ascending order nums,
square the elements and give the output in sorted order

Example 1
    Input
        nums = [-9, -2, 0, 2, 3]

    Output
        [0,4,4,9,81]

Example 2

Input
    nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

Output
    nums = [1,4,9,16,25]
'''

class Solution:
    def solve(self, nums):
        arr = []
        for i in(nums):
            arr.append(i**2)
        arr.sort()
        return arr

print(Solution().solve([-9, -2, 0, 2, 3]))

'''
1. We initialize an empty array which is 'arr' in this case
2. We loop through all the elements in nums and append the squared value of it into arr
3. We sort arr and return it
